Flight Booking App (Beginner Project)💡 Project Overview: Learning & Core ConceptsThe Flight Booking App is a hands-on, beginner-friendly project designed to demonstrate core front-end development concepts using React and the Material UI (MUI) component library.This application simulates the process of searching and displaying flight information using mock local data. It focuses entirely on the user interface, state management, and component architecture without relying on a live backend or external API.Key Learning ObjectivesComponent-Based Architecture: Structuring a complex UI (search forms, results lists, navigation) into reusable React components.State Management: Handling user input, filtering logic, and displaying results using React Hooks ($\text{useState}$, $\text{useEffect}$).Material Design Implementation: Practical use of Material UI components (Grid, Typography, Button, Paper, DatePicker) to build a professional and responsive design.Data Handling: Importing and manipulating local mock data to populate the UI.User Interaction: Implementing form validation and dynamic filtering based on user selections.⚙️ Technologies UsedThis project is built using a modern front-end stack that provides a smooth developer experience and beautiful user interface.FrontendCore Framework: ReactUI/Design: Material UI (MUI) for all components, icons, and styling.Data Source: Local Mock Data (e.g., a JavaScript object or JSON file used to simulate an API response).Language: JavaScript (or TypeScript, depending on your setup). Getting StartedFollow these simple steps to run the application on your local development machine.PrerequisitesEnsure you have Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system.InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/Echika/Flight-booking.git
Navigate to the front-end application directory:Bashcd Flight-booking/flight-booking-app
Install dependencies:This command will install React, Material UI, and any other necessary libraries.Bashnpm install
# or yarn install
▶️ Running the ApplicationTo start the development server:Bashnpm start
# or yarn start
The application will automatically open in your default browser at $\text{http://localhost:3000/}$.📂 Project StructureThe key files and directories are organized as follows:flight-booking-app/
